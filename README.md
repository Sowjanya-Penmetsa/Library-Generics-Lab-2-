# Library-Generics-Lab-2-

In this solution I have created a Book Class in which a list is created to hold the book info,Sorted the books based on Year if the year is same based on title
I have created a one more class called Library and library iterator to demonstrate the usage of IEnumarable and IEnumerator interfaces.
